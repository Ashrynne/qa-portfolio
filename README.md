# QA Portfolio Showcase
### About me:
```I am a self-learner and enjoy software, both using, as well as breaking it. Even though I am not new to IT in general, my dream is to establish myself in the QA industry and work in a team of passionate people, from whom I can learn and improve myself each day. I spend a lot of time with all kinds of software, usually open-source from different repositories on Linux, but also on Github, finding what suits my needs. I am good at adapting to different situations and conditions. With this portfolio I want to show the bulk of what I know so far, that is relevant for a position of a Junior QA Engineer. It is a constant work in progress and will expand, as I gain new knowledge, both personal and corporate. I may be lacking experience working at a tech company as of right now, but I need someone to give me an opportunity and a problem to solve.
    The portfolio, specifically sections that have to do with test cases, bug reports and so on, will be largely based on a piece of software that I created for testing: https://github.com/Ashrynne/dewit-app.git
